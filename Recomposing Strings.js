/*
In this challenge, the goal is recomposing scrambled strings made of two or more words.

Every string has to be reversed not in its totality, but by vowels or consonants clusters in the order they are found; after splitting the string in groups, and reversing every group with more than a letter, you'll obtain the correct sequence:

String = "KiKdaola"

Separation vowels/consonants = K  i  Kd  ao  l  a

Reversing the groups = K  i  dK  oa  l  a

New string = KidKoala
Now, you have to insert a space between the words. A word starts with a capital letter:

String = "KidKoala"

Result = "Kid Koala"
Given a string, implement a function that returns, in turn, a new correct string, following the above instructions.

Examples
recompose("KiKdaola") ➞ "Kid Koala"

recompose("BaosdrOCfanada") ➞ "Boards Of Canada"
// B  ao  sdr  O  Cf  a  n  a  d  a
// B  oa  rds  O  fC  a  n  a  d  a

recompose("hCemicarBlohtesr") ➞ "Chemical Brothers"
// hC  e  m  i  c  a  rBl  o  ht  e  sr
// Ch  e  m  i  c  a  lBr  o  th  e  rs
